# 1st Annual Compiler Frontiers Workshop (2022)

*Held in conjunction with the [19th ACM International Conference on Computing Frontiers](https://www.computingfrontiers.org/2022/) *

As architectures grow in complexity and power/performance requirements evolve
far beyond what traditional data center environments offer, we find that
compilers are becoming increasingly paramount in constructing performant,
power-efficient, and resilient application payloads. The ability to build
programming model support, compilers, optimizers, and associated tooling for
advanced architectures is now at the forefront of computer science and computer
architecture research. This workshop seeks to bring together researchers and
experts from industry and academia to present the latest advances in Compilers
for Computing Frontiers.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

*	Compiler extensions for HPC, HPDC, IoT, Cloud, and Edge computing
*	Compiler design for low power environments
*	Compiler design for extreme parallelism
*	Compiler optimizations and optimization frameworks
*	Compiler optimizations for high-level abstractions
*	Extensions to existing compiler frameworks: CLANG, GCC, MLIR, LLVM, etc.
*	Template meta-programming constructs
*	Domain-specific language compilers
*	Compiler re-targeting for non-traditional/special-purpose architectures
*	Compiler extensions for AI/ML architectures
*	Application of ML to compiler technologies
*	Compiler design for hardware description languages
*	Compiler extensions for High-Level Synthesis tools targeting FPGAs or ASICs


## Important Dates

*	Paper submissions due: February 20, 2021
*	Notifications of acceptance: TBD
*	Camera-ready papers due: TBD
*	Workshop date: TBD


## Submission Guidelines

Authors are encouraged to submit papers of up to 6 pages, including references,
describing novel work. Authors are welcome to make submissions describing
early-stage, in-progress, and/or exploratory work in order to elicit feedback,
discover collaboration opportunities, and spark discussion. Accepted papers will
be published in the workshop section of the Computing Frontiers proceedings.

All paper submissions must adhere to the official 
[ACM conference format](http://www.acm.org/publications/article-templates/proceedings-template.html). 
As the review process is double-blind, removal of all identifying information
from paper submissions is required (i.e., cite own work in third person). Papers
not conforming to the above submission policies on formatting, page limits, and
the removal of identifying information will be automatically rejected. Authors
are strongly advised to submit their papers with the final list of authors, as
changes may not be feasible later.

All papers must be submitted through the official submission website:
