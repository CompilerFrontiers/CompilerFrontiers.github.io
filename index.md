Held in conjunction with the [18th ACM International Conference on Computing Frontiers](http://www.computingfrontiers.org/2021/) 

## Abstract

## Format

This workshop will feature contributed papers and invited talks focusing on recent 
developments from both academia and industry the pertain to the state of the art 
in compiler technology.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
* Compiler extensions for HPC, HPDC, IoT, Cloud and Edge computing
* Compiler design for low power environments
* Compiler design for extreme parallelism
* Compiler optimizations and optimization frameworks
* Extensions to existing compiler frameworks: LLVM, GCC, etc
* Template meta-programming constructs
* Domain specific language compilers
* Compiler re-targeting for non-traditional architectures

## Deadlines

* Paper submissions due: February 26, 2021
* Notifications to authors of acceptance: March 18, 2021
* Camera-ready papers due: March 25, 2021
* Workshop date: TBD

## Submissions

Authors are encouraged to submit full papers of 4-6 pages.  Each full 
paper will be considered for publication in the workshop section of 
the Computing Frontiers proceedings.  For very early access work, 
authors may also submit a 2 page extended abstract.  However,
authors of extended abstracts will be asked to give a virtual presentation 
during the workshop, but will not be included in the official Computing Frontiers 
proceedings.

All papers must be submitted through the official workshop Easychair page:
