# 1st Annual Compiler Frontiers Workshop (2021)
Held in conjunction with the [18th ACM International Conference on Computing Frontiers](http://www.computingfrontiers.org/2021/) 

## Abstract

As architectures become increasingly complex and drive power/performance requirements 
far beyond traditional data center environments, we find that compilers are becoming 
increasingly paramount in constructing performant, power efficient and resilient 
application payloads.  The ability construct programming model support, compilers, optimizers 
and associated tooling for advanced architectures is now at the forefront of computer 
science and computer architecture research.  This workshop seeks to bring together 
researchers and experts from industry and academia in order to present the latest 
advances in Compilers for Computing Frontiers.

## Format

This workshop will feature contributed papers and invited talks focusing on recent 
developments from both academia and industry the pertain to the state of the art 
in compiler technology.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
* Compiler extensions for HPC, HPDC, IoT, Cloud and Edge computing
* Compiler design for low power environments
* Compiler design for extreme parallelism
* Compiler optimizations and optimization frameworks
* Extensions to existing compiler frameworks: LLVM, GCC, etc
* Template meta-programming constructs
* Domain specific language compilers
* Compiler re-targeting for non-traditional/special-purpose architectures
* Compiler advances for AI/ML architectures

## Deadlines

* Paper submissions due: February 26, 2021
* Notifications to authors of acceptance: March 18, 2021
* Camera-ready papers due: March 25, 2021
* Workshop date: TBD

## Submissions

Authors are encouraged to submit full papers of 4-6 pages.  Each full 
paper will be considered for publication in the workshop section of 
the Computing Frontiers proceedings.  For very early access work, 
authors may also submit a 2 page extended abstract.  However,
authors of extended abstracts will be asked to give a virtual presentation 
during the workshop, but will not be included in the official Computing Frontiers 
proceedings.

ALl paper and extended abstract submissions must adhere to official [ACM conference format](http://www.acm.org/publications/article-templates/proceedings-template.html).  As the review process is double-blind, removal of all identifying information from paper submissions is required (i.e., cite own work in third person). Papers not conforming to the above submission policies on formatting, page limits and the removal of identifying information will be automatically rejected. Authors are strongly advised to submit their papers with the final list of authors, as changes may not be feasible at later stages.

All papers must be submitted through the official workshop Easychair page:
