## Submission Guidelines

Authors are encouraged to submit papers of up to 6 pages, excluding references,
describing novel work. Authors are welcome to make submissions describing
early-stage, in-progress, and/or exploratory work in order to elicit feedback,
discover collaboration opportunities, and spark discussion. Accepted papers will
be published in the workshop section of the Computing Frontiers proceedings.

All paper submissions must adhere to the official 
[ACM conference format](http://www.acm.org/publications/article-templates/proceedings-template.html). 
As the review process is double-blind, removal of all identifying information
from paper submissions is required (i.e., cite own work in third person). Papers
not conforming to the above submission policies on formatting, page limits, and
the removal of identifying information will be automatically rejected. Authors
are strongly advised to submit their papers with the final list of authors, as
changes may not be feasible later.

All papers must be submitted through the official submission website: 
[Easychair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cfw23)
