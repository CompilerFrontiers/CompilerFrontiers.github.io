# 2nd Annual Compiler Frontiers Workshop (2023)

*Held in conjunction with the* [20th ACM International Conference on Computing Frontiers](https://www.computingfrontiers.org/2023/)

As architectures grow in complexity and power/performance requirements evolve
far beyond what traditional data center environments offer, advances in compiler
technology are paramount to enable the construction of performant,
power-efficient, and resilient application payloads. The ability to build
programming model support, compilers, optimizers, and associated tooling for
advanced architectures is now at the forefront of computer science and computer
architecture research. This workshop seeks to bring together researchers and
experts from industry and academia to present the latest advances in Compilers
for Computing Frontiers.
