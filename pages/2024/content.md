# 3nd Annual Compiler Frontiers Workshop (2024)

*Held in conjunction with the* [21th ACM International Conference on Computing Frontiers](https://www.computingfrontiers.org/2024/)

As architectures grow in complexity and power/performance requirements evolve
far beyond what traditional data center environments offer, advances in compiler
technology are paramount to enable the construction of performant,
power-efficient, and resilient application payloads.  In this era of expanding
architectural possibilities, this workshop seeks new research in compilers
tailored for traditional architectures but also for the unique challenges posed
by physical computing systems, where a system of differential equations
describes their temporal evolution.  In addition to compiler technologies
enabling new features (co-processors, accelerated instructions, tensor memory
architecture engines, etc.) in traditional architectures (CPUs, GPUs, CGRAs,
FPGAs), this year, in CFW, we seek to explore new compilation techniques for the
intricacies inherent in emerging computing paradigms such as analog computing,
neuromorphic computing, near and in-memory processing, chemical reaction
networks, among others, expanding the discussion to creative solutions when
compiling for physical computing systems.  This workshop serves as a gathering
ground for researchers and experts from both industry and academia, fostering
the presentation and exploration of the latest advances in Compilers for
Computing Frontiers.
