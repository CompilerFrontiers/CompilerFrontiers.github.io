# 3rd Annual Compiler Frontiers Workshop (2024)

*Held in conjunction with the* [21th ACM International Conference on Computing Frontiers](https://www.computingfrontiers.org/2024/)

As architectures grow in complexity and power/performance requirements evolve
far beyond what traditional computing facilities offer, advances in compiler
technology are paramount to enable the construction of performant,
power-efficient, and resilient application payloads. In this era of expanding
architectural possibilities, this workshop seeks new research in compilers
tailored for traditional architectures but also for the unique challenges posed
by physical computing systems that perform computations based on their analog
behavior. In addition to compiler technologies enabling new features
(co-processors, accelerated instructions, tensor memory architecture engines,
etc.) in traditional architectures (CPUs, GPUs, CGRAs, FPGAs), this year, in
CFW, we seek to explore new compilation techniques for the intricacies inherent
in emerging computing paradigms, such as analog computing, neuromorphic
computing, near and in-memory processing, chemical reaction networks, among
others, expanding the discussion to creative solutions when compiling for
physical computing systems. This workshop serves as a gathering ground for
researchers and experts from both industry and academia, fostering the
presentation and exploration of the latest advances in Compilers for Computing
Frontiers.
