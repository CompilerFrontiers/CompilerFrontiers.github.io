## Submission Guidelines

This year, we are accepting two types of submissions: Full Papers and Extended
Abstracts.

**Full Papers:**
Authors are encouraged to submit full papers of up to 6 pages, <u>excluding</u>
references, describing novel work. Authors may buy up to two (2) extra pages for accepted regular papers.

**Extended Abstracts:**
Authors are welcome to submit short papers describing early-stage, in-progress,
and/or exploratory work to elicit feedback, discover collaboration
opportunities, and spark discussion. Extended abstracts should be up to 2 pages,
<u>including</u> references. Please, during submission, prefix your title with
the string "EA:" to indicate that you are submitting an extended abstract.

**Important**: All accepted papers will be published in the workshop section of
the Computing Frontiers proceedings. Moreover, at least one author must register and present the paper at the workshop in person.

All paper submissions must adhere to the official 
[ACM conference format](http://www.acm.org/publications/article-templates/proceedings-template.html). 
As the review process is double-blind, removal of all identifying information
from paper submissions is required (i.e., cite own work in third person). Papers
not conforming to the above submission policies on formatting, page limits, and
the removal of identifying information will be automatically rejected. Authors
are strongly advised to submit their papers with the final list of authors, as
changes may not be feasible later.

All papers must be submitted through the official submission website:
